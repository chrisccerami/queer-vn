## What is this repo?

Hey! Thanks for asking. This is the source code for a visual novel I'm working on about what it's like as a queer person in the world of online dating. It's still very much a work in progress, but you can feel free to check out its current state at https://queer-vn.herokuapp.com.

## Content Warnings

If you play the game or read through the scripts in the `public/data` folder, then you should be aware that there's some stuff in there that some people may not like or may find inappropriate.

For one, this is a game about a queer online dating experience, so obviously there's a chance you may end up reading about sex between people of various genders. If that's not your thing, then this probably isn't the place for you.

This game also attempts to address things like homophobia, bi-phobia, bi erasure, transphobia, and other struggles of the queer dating scene. Because of this, you might encounter strong language or slurs of a homophobic, bi-phobic, or transphobic nature. My intention is to not include any of these things lightly, but to only use them when I find it necessary for the message of this game. That being said, they do still exist in the game, and I understand that some people would rather not be exposed to it and I respect that decision.
